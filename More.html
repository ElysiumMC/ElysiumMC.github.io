                Had the privilege to drop by this wonderful realm (ELYSIUM) created by a group of friends. The founder of this realm are siblings and they decided to purchase a realm with their own pocket money and make the best use of COVID19 lockdown. Talk about financial responsibility at a young age! What is even more awesome is that they even attracted players from different countries such as America and the Philipines.
                With just a span of a few months and committed friends, they even have an in-game shopping system, complex mining tunnels, a beautiful garden with different marine species and daily nightly tours to introduce their team members! To the younger generation playing minecraft, it is always the best to play together as a community, and be kind to one another. Right now, the owners have plans to expand. I will leave the owners to reach out directly to players who are interested in joining their realm, to prevent their channels from being flooded.

                The founders of Minecraft Malaysian Group also started off with a small community. Our legendary players like Yusri used to also flood my server with lava XD.
                PS: Admin made a mistake by stealing diamonds from one of the players and had to mine back the diamonds as payment. So when you join the server, don't take anything, ASK first.
